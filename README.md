Scripts
=======

Useful scripts that I wrote. Added this directory to my PATH so I can use them anywhere.

File Overview:
--------------
1. syscall - Python script to lookup a reference file (.data32 or .data64) for system calls. Usage "syscall 20". Run "syscall -h" for help
2. asm - Python script to store and siplay my notes on assembly (file called .asm_reference). Mine is using intel x86 style... Usage: "asm lods"
3. copy - one line bash script to pipe command output to clipboard. Uses xclip. Usage: "some command | copy"
